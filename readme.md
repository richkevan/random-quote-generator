This was project 1 of 5 for my FreeCodeCamp(ðŸ”¥) Front End libraries certification.

This was started with a static HTML page that uses React and Babel hosted on CDNs to dynamically fetch a new quote from an API endpoint. Tweet button currently passes the quote and author to the twitter tweet url so you can share whatever quotes inspire you.
